# studio-reflect

Python server and plugin for updating scripts in ROBLOX Studio as changes are made to disc.

Real readme eventually, since setup does require some instruction, though for now the files explain it fairly well.

Plugin can be accessed [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/914562514/Studio-Reflect).
